# DP's Portfolio Website ✨
A portfolio website is a curated, online space that showcases your best work. It’s one of the most practical and memorable ways to share your work with press, potential collaborators or employers.

Much like your PDF portfolio, a portfolio website can be used when applying for jobs or internships.
## What goes into a portfolio website?
While there are no set rules, generally speaking, a portfolio website is made up of the following:

- A homepage is also known as a landing page, this is the first thing a visitor sees when they come to your website.
- An ‘About Me’ or ‘Contact’ page, this is where you include personal and contact information, for example:
- Your full name and pronouns
- Email address
- Telephone number
- A short statement about yourself and your practice
